- stoical, proof-of-concept ELF crypter (apparently 32-bit only)
    Name taken from wiktionary's word of the day archive.
    Created for educational purposes, not obligatory to be continued.

- description
    Rewrites entry point to loaded decrpying stub, crypts your code.
    Code resides in the end of .text, so some code could get corrupted.
    It has one single and simple unittest.

- requirements
    gcc, nasm, linux(shouldn't be too unportable), ruby

- issues
    The code at the end of .text might be called at some point,
    when that happens a segfault will probably occur.

- usage
    ./main <elf>

- example
    % make
    % cp /bin/zsh .
    % ./main zsh
    % echo "echo $(( 9 * 9 ))" | ./zsh
    81
    % md5sum /bin/zsh zsh
